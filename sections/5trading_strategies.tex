\section{Trading Strategies - Introduction and Theory}
\subsection{Idea and Process}
We compare different Trading Strategies. With the Goal of Predicting Stocks this is interesting in and of itself. For the purpose of the project it also serves as a baseline to compare our Trading Strategy against. 

\subsection{Mean Reversion Models and Momentum Trading - Theoretical Background}

A vast body of scientific literature has tried to develop models that allow to understand and explain movements in stock markets. An even vaster community of traders has tried to implement these theories to do actual forecasting. While many of the theories are much more complex, two basic ideas can be summarized as "Momentum Based Trading" and "Mean Reversion Based Trading". The former theory hypothesizes that stocks that do well now will likely continue to do so in the future while the latter states that especially good or past performance is an exception and that stocks will eventually return to their average performance. A third strategy, Pairs Trading, will be detailed later. 

In 1985 [Bondt and Thaler] were one of the early scholars to analyze mean reversion behaviour when they examined the hypothesis that markets tend to overreact. They looked at monthly returns of assets listed on the New York Stock Exchange in between 1926 and 1982 and constructed portfolios  of winners and losers that were updated every three years. Winners and losers were those stocks that had performed the best / worst over the previous years. Their idea was that "if stock prices systematically overshoot, then their reversal should be predictable from past return data alone, with no use of any accounting data such as earnings. [...] Extreme movements in stock prices will be followed by subsequent price movements in the opposite direction." Indeed they observed that the portfolio of losers outperformed the market significantly. While they focus on a very long time horizon of three years, Jagadeesh(1991) suggests that this behaviour could also be observed in the shorter term:  "These papers show that contrarian strategies that select stocks based on their returns in the previous week or month generate significant abnormal returns." 
While mean reversion behaviour has sometimes been observed in practice, it is not trivial to derive it from economic theory. Many economic theories like the famous model from Fama and French describe the return of the stocks of a company as the result of market properties like the baseline market return rate and inherent properties of that company, like for example its book-to-market-ratio [Fama and French 1993]. If such a relationship exists than this in turn implies that the actual observed stock movements should be random fluctuations around some much more slowly changing true return rate. However, it is unclear whether this mean reversion should happen in the form of a pendulum that swings forth and back or more in the form of coin tosses reverting to their equilibrium by flooding past observations with new random ones. 
Something about multiplicative connections?

On the opposite side of the spectrum of trading strategies lies the idea of momentum. [Japateesh and CX] in 1993 were one of the first to describe "that strategies which buy stocks that have performed well in the past and sell stocks that have performed poorly in the past generate significant positive returns over 3- to 12-month holding periods." [Japateesh and CX] looked at portfolios and saw mean reversion over 12 to 48 months. Thaler and Bondt observe mean reversion over the time frame of 36 months. Many scholares agree that mean reversion and momentum behaviour are not necessarily contradictions, but that the time frame determines in which way a stock will behave [Balvers and Wu].

\section{Trading Strategies - Implementation}
\subsection{Mean Reversion Portfolio}
While their analysis is focused on monthly returns over a much longer time frame, the basic idea that was replicated in our trading strategy was the same. While they found excessive returns of that strategy from 1932 to 1977 our implementation was unforturnately much less successful.

\end{figure}{}

Implementation algorithm: rank portfolio everyday along their returns from the last day. Then buy the two worst performers and sell the two best performers. Interestingly, reversing that does not produce better results. The time frame is obviously not right.

Idea: 
Plot: Cumulative Mean vs. Actual Time Series
--> We see that the cumulative mean does not capture the time series well. Trend is always behind the current development, since we have a trend

\subsubsection{Comparison of 90d and 30d moving averages}
Idea: If 30d averages is above 90d average, then sell. And vice versa

\subsubsection{Mean Reversion Portfolio}
Idea: Look at entire portfolio.
